# AI-Powered Recipe Generator

This is a Python-based AI-powered recipe generator that suggests recipes based on the user's available ingredients.

## Features

- Takes user input for available ingredients.
- Matches ingredients with a small built-in recipe database.
- Displays fully matching and partially matching recipes.
- Shows step-by-step instructions for the selected recipe.

## How It Works

1. The user provides a comma-separated list of ingredients.
2. The system checks a pre-defined recipe database.
3. It suggests recipes that match all or some of the ingredients.
4. The user can select a recipe to view its cooking steps.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python recipe_generator.py
```

3. Enter ingredients when prompted and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Future Improvements

- Use natural language processing to understand more complex ingredient input.
- Allow saving favorite recipes.
- Integrate with an online recipe API for dynamic suggestions.
